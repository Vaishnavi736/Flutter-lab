General & Basic Questions

1. What is Flutter?

Flutter is an open-source UI toolkit by Google used to build cross-platform apps from 

a single codebase.

2. Which programming language is used in Flutter?

Flutter uses the Dart programming language.

3. What is Dart?

Dart is an object-oriented, class-based language optimized for UI development with 

features like hot reload and AOT compilation.

4. What are Widgets in Flutter?

Widgets are the building blocks of a Flutter app’s UI. Everything in Flutter (text, 

image, layout, etc.) is a widget.

5. Differentiate between Stateless and Stateful widgets.

Stateless widgets are immutable (don’t change once built).

Stateful widgets can change dynamically when user interaction or data changes occur.

6. What is the main() function in Dart?

It is the entry point of every Dart program where execution begins.

7. What is Hot Reload in Flutter?

Hot Reload allows developers to instantly see code changes in the emulator without 

restarting the entire app.

8. What is MaterialApp in Flutter?

It is a predefined class that wraps several widgets implementing Material Design 

principles for UI.

9. What is Scaffold?

Scaffold provides a basic structure for a visual interface — including AppBar, Body, 

Drawer, and FloatingActionButton.

10. What is AppBar in Flutter?

AppBar is a Material Design widget that provides a toolbar with title, icons, and 

actions.

Widgets & Layout

11. Name some basic Flutter widgets.

Text, Image, Container, Icon, Column, Row, Stack, Card, ListView, etc.

12. What is the purpose of Row and Column widgets?

Row arranges children horizontally, and Column arranges them vertically.

13. What is Stack used for?

Stack allows widgets to be placed on top of each other (like overlapping layers).

Navigation & Responsiveness

16. What is navigation in Flutter?

It allows switching between different screens (routes) in an app using Navigator.

17. What are named routes?

Named routes define a map of route names and corresponding widgets for easier 

navigation.

18. How do you make a Flutter app responsive?

Use MediaQuery and layout builders with width-based breakpoints to adapt UI to 

various screen sizes.

19. What are MediaQuery and Breakpoints?

MediaQuery provides screen size info.

Breakpoints define width thresholds for responsive design.

20. What are the types of navigation in Flutter?

Basic navigation using Navigator.push() and named route navigation using 

Navigator.pushNamed().

State Management & Customization

21. What is setState()?

setState() updates the state of a StatefulWidget and rebuilds the UI with new data.

22. What is the Provider package used for?

Provider is used for efficient state management across multiple widgets.

23. What are custom widgets?

User-defined widgets created for code reuse and modular design.

24. What is a Theme in Flutter?

A theme defines the overall styling of an app like colors, text styles, and icon themes.

25. How do you apply custom styles using ThemeData?

Define a ThemeData object in MaterialApp’s theme: property and apply consistent 

styles throughout the app.

Forms, Animations, and APIs

26. What is form validation in Flutter?

It ensures that user inputs are valid using Form, TextFormField, and validation 

functions.

27. What is an AnimationController?

A controller that manages the timing and state of an animation in Flutter.

28. Name two types of animations you used.

Fade animation (AnimatedOpacity) and Slide animation (SlideTransition).

29. How do you fetch data from a REST API?

Using the http package to make GET/POST requests and FutureBuilder to display 

fetched data.

30. How can you debug a Flutter app?

Using tools like Hot Reload, Flutter Inspector, Debug Console, Breakpoints, and 

DevTools for performance analysis.
